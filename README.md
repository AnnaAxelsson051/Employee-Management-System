## Description

This is an application with a menu that enables time reporting for employers - to store persons, projects and amount of hours worked in a database. Employers can register person and project names in the database, as well as the amount of time a person has worked on a specific project. Already stored data can later be modified, as employers may alter person and project names as well as time that employees spent on projects.
