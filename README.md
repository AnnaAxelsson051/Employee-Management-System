## Description

This is an application with a menu that enables time reporting for employers - to store employees, projects and amount of hours worked in a database. Employers can register employee and project names in the database, as well as the amount of time an employee has worked on a specific project. Already stored data can later be modified, as employers may alter employee and project names, as well as the time employees spent working on projects.
